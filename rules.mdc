# Best Practices in Software

1. Ignore "Best Practices" That Add Complexity
Don't add interfaces until you have multiple implementations
Don't add abstractions until you have multiple use cases
Don't add patterns until you have multiple examples
2. Ignore "Enterprise" Patterns
Don't add factories unless you need multiple creation methods
Don't add builders unless you have complex construction logic
Don't add repositories unless you have multiple storage backends
3. Ignore "Performance" Optimizations
Don't optimize until you have performance problems
Don't add caching until you have performance problems
Don't add pooling until you have performance problems
4. Ignore "Extensibility" Requirements
Don't add plugin systems until you have plugins
Don't add configuration systems until you have configuration needs
Don't add event systems until you have events
The Simplicity Test:
Before adding any complexity, ask:
"Does this solve a real problem I have right now?"
"Is this the simplest way to solve it?"
"Will this make the code easier or harder to understand?"
"Will this make the code easier or harder to change?"
If the answer to any of these questions suggests complexity, don't add it.
