# Contributing to Tangent

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tangent! We welcome contributions from the community.

## Ways to Contribute

- 🐛 Report bugs
- 💡 Suggest features
- 📝 Improve documentation
- 🎨 Add new character designs to the library
- 🔧 Fix issues
- ✨ Add new features

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tangent.git
cd tangent
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Ensure Go 1.21+ is installed
go version

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Build tangent CLI
cd cmd/tangent
go build -o tangent .
./tangent
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture

Tangent follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer** (`pkg/characters/domain/`): Core business logic and entities
- **Service Layer** (`pkg/characters/service/`): Application logic and orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`pkg/characters/infrastructure/`): External concerns and implementations
- **Package Interface** (`pkg/characters/`): Public API and backward compatibility

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed information.

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and testable
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

### Testing

Tangent uses a comprehensive testing strategy:

#### Unit Tests
- Each layer has unit tests in `*_test.go` files
- Mock dependencies for isolated testing
- Test both success and error cases

#### Test Structure
```
pkg/characters/
├── domain/
│   └── *_test.go
├── service/
│   └── *_test.go
└── infrastructure/
    └── *_test.go
```

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./pkg/characters/infrastructure
go test ./pkg/characters/service
go test ./pkg/characters/domain

# Test the CLI
cd cmd/tangent && go run main.go session.go
```

#### Test Guidelines
- Write tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies

### Examples

If adding features, include examples in `examples/`:
```bash
examples/
└── your_feature/
    ├── main.go
    └── README.md
```

## Adding Library Characters

Want to add a character to the library?

### 1. Create Character File

```go
// pkg/characters/library/robot.go
package library

func Robot() LibraryCharacter {
    return LibraryCharacter{
        Name: "robot",
        Description: "Friendly robot with waving animation",
        Author: "Your Name",
        Frames: map[string][]string{
            "idle": {
                "__R6FFF6L__",
                "_T6FFFFF5T_",
                "___11_22___",
            },
            "wave": {
                "__R6FFF6L__",
                "__6FFFFF5T1",
                "___11_22___",
            },
        },
    }
}
```

### 2. Register in Library

```go
// pkg/characters/library/library.go
