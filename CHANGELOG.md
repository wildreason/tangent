This release represents a complete architectural refactoring of Tangent, implementing proper layered architecture with enhanced error handling, comprehensive testing, and improved maintainability.

### Major Changes

#### Architecture Improvements
- **NEW**: Implemented proper layered architecture (Domain, Service, Infrastructure layers)
- **NEW**: Added comprehensive error handling with contextual suggestions
- **NEW**: Implemented Builder Pattern v2 with fluent API and validation
- **NEW**: Added centralized error handling system with user-friendly messages
- **NEW**: Enhanced pattern compilation with detailed validation
- **NEW**: Improved file repository with pre-validation and error reporting

#### Code Quality
- **NEW**: Comprehensive test coverage for all layers
- **NEW**: Mock implementations for testing
- **NEW**: Enhanced validation throughout the system
- **NEW**: Proper dependency injection and interface-driven design
- **NEW**: Clean separation of concerns

#### Documentation
- **CLEANED**: Removed 30+ unnecessary documentation files
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Consolidated to 5 essential documentation files
- **IMPROVED**: Clear, focused user experience
- **MAINTAINED**: One source of truth for each type of information

#### Backward Compatibility
- **MAINTAINED**: All existing functionality preserved
- **MAINTAINED**: Zero external dependencies for core functionality
- **MAINTAINED**: Single binary distribution
- **MAINTAINED**: Existing API compatibility

### Technical Details
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Service Layer**: Application logic and orchestration

## [0.0.1] - 2025-10-07

**Initial Development History**

This version represents the complete development history of Tangent from initial concept through architectural refactoring.

### Development Phases Completed
- **Phase 1**: Domain Layer implementation with proper interfaces
- **Phase 2**: Service Layer with application logic and validation
- **Phase 3**: Infrastructure Layer with concrete implementations
- **Phase 4**: Enhanced error handling with contextual suggestions
- **Phase 5**: Main function integration with new architecture
- **Phase 6**: Comprehensive testing implementation
- **Phase 7**: Documentation cleanup and simplification

### Key Features Developed
- **Character Design System**: Pattern-based character creation
- **Visual Builder**: Interactive CLI character designer
- **Library System**: Pre-built characters (alien, pulse, wave, rocket)
- **Animation Engine**: Built-in terminal animation
- **Frame Extraction API**: TUI framework integration
- **Bubble Tea Adapter**: Seamless Bubble Tea integration
- **CLI Tools**: Interactive and non-interactive modes
- **Session Management**: Save/load character projects
- **Export System**: Generate Go code from designs

### Technical Achievements
- **Zero Dependencies**: Core functionality uses only Go stdlib
- **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage with mocks
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with suggestions
- **Documentation**: Clean, focused documentation structure
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved
