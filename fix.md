1. adding agent state workflow
- start from based? is good
- next workflow is a headache

### painpoints creating a state

#### editing the line by line frame
- have to remember the base codes
- the current shows only the blocks (not codes)
- ideal:
- option 1: show codes
- option 2: offer duplicate or copy

#### lack of live preview
- if i edit a base copy, i should know whether
the frames animate as I intented. 
- current workflow waits for me to finish
the lines and create a state and then check
whether the animation works or not
- ideal:
- option 1: live preview after every confirmation
- option 2: you tell

#### post creation preview state animation
does not show the animation but codes
✓ Standard state 'plan' added with 3 frames!
